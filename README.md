## Methodology
The assessment is based in the methodology proposed by Yunseon Choi in ["A complete Assessment of Tagging Quality: A consolidated Methodology")](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23198). The analysis includes 3 phases: analysis of indexing consistency, analysis of tagging effectiveness and analysis of the semantic values of tags. At the moment the assessment includes the first two phases.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the tagging results of the 2019 HNO Nigeria report according to the IFRC MASTER FRAMEWORK 2019. The document was tagged in parallel by 4 analysts.
